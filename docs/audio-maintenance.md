# Audio and data maintenance

These workflows update reviewed project data. They are not required for normal
setup.

## Update a pinned audio snapshot

1. Change the 40-character revision in `config/source_snapshots.json`.
2. Download into clean generated `audio/` and `imports/` directories.
3. Review counts, hashes, duplicates, pitch contours, and speaker quality.
4. Update expected counts and representative hashes in the snapshot file.
5. Run `npm run verify:setup`.

Normal setup deliberately does not regenerate canonical vocabulary,
definitions, recordings, or quality policy from moving upstream sources.

## Import local human recordings

Place audio under a source and exact Mandarin word:

```text
imports/
  forvo/
    公司/
      speaker-name.mp3
      speaker-name.json
```

Optional sidecar:

```json
{
  "speaker": "speaker-name",
  "sex": "f",
  "country": "CHN",
  "region": "Beijing",
  "surface_pattern": "1-1",
  "source_url": "https://example.com/source"
}
```

Import the files:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_local_audio.py
```

Imported sources are indexed, but native quiz prompts currently select only
verified `audio_cmn` recordings.

## Corpus tools

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `download_audio_cmn.py` | Download isolated native words |
| `download_audio_cmn_syllables.py` | Download human tone syllables |
| `download_public_pinyin_syllables.py` | Download public comparison syllables |
| `check_audio_cmn_syllables.py` | Check duplicate and malformed syllable audio |
| `pad_audio_cmn_syllables.py` | Export padded syllable MP3 files |
| `forvo_inventory.py` | Inventory Forvo pronunciations without caching audio |
| `common_voice_index.py` | Index Mandarin Common Voice context clips |
| `download_openai_tts_sample.py` | Create optional synthetic samples |

Correction playback always uses tone-specific syllable recordings, never an
unlabeled word recording. Ambiguous Hanzi readings require matching recording
metadata before they can enter the quiz.

The browser adds 120 ms of leading silence and 200 ms of trailing silence to
decoded correction audio in memory. It copies decoded PCM without changing
pitch, timing, or consonant distinctions.
